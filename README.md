# System Design Repository
> This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of system design concepts and examples using `Mermaid diagrams` and `draw.io`.

### What is Mermaid?
[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/) is a simple yet powerful markdown-like language for generating diagrams, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. It enables developers to represent system architectures and interactions in a visual and intuitive manner.

### What is draw.io?
[draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (also known as diagrams.net) is a powerful free online and offline tool that allows you to create a wide variety of diagrams such as flowcharts, process diagrams, UML diagrams, ER models, network diagrams, and more. It supports different formats and platforms, making it incredibly versatile. You can save your diagrams directly to services like Google Drive or Dropbox, or download them to your local machine in different formats like PNG, JPEG, SVG, or the editable `.drawio` format.

### Getting Started
To explore the system design diagrams and accompanying documentation, simply `navigate` to the `relevant folders` within this repository. Each diagram is provided in Markdown format for Mermaid diagrams or `.drawio` format for draw.io diagrams, making it easy to view and edit using standard markdown editors, draw.io platform, or rendering tools.
