# System Design Repository
> This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of system design concepts and examples using `Mermaid diagrams`.

### What is Mermaid?
[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/#/) is a simple yet powerful markdown-like language for generating diagrams, including flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and more. It enables developers to represent system architectures and interactions in a visual and intuitive manner.

### Getting Started
To explore the system design diagrams and accompanying documentation, simply navigate to the relevant folders within this repository. Each diagram is provided in Markdown format, making it easy to view and edit using standard markdown editors or rendering tools.
